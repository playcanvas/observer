 * The Observer module provides a robust implementation of the observer pattern, an essential

 * observable objects that notify registered observers automatically whenever changes occur. This
 * module is instrumental in developing reactive interfaces and facilitating communication between
 * different parts of an application, enhancing modularity and responsiveness.
